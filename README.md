## 📊 Correlation Between BTC and ETH Returns

This project explores the correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) daily returns using data from the CoinGecko API. It includes an analysis of both price returns and volatility over the past year.

The project is built using R and Quarto and features:
- Interactive and animated visualizations using `plotly`
- Rolling volatility charts using 30-day standard deviation
- A clean Quarto website with separate pages for analysis, sources, and background

Data is programmatically collected using a custom R script and stored in `.rds` files to streamline reproducibility and avoid API rate limits.

This work was created as part of [Kane’s Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/) and is intended as a foundation for future research in crypto market behavior.
